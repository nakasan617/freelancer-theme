## Content Defined Merkle Tree ##
This is CDMT implementation and code that was used to do the actual experiment in the paper.
I will add the README shortly in the repo.

## SimpleBlockChain ##
This is a C++ version of a simple blockchain I have implemented in Java earlier in the distributed system class. I am currently struggling with dealing with JSON format output in C++. I will probably work on it on spring break. This is to basically show that I understand the basics of blockchain technology.

## Unbeatable Connect4 ##
This repo uses minmax algorithm to calculate the best strategy set to get the nash equilibrium strategy. 
I will make a repo solely for this now that I have this website hehe.
